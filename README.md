Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering can be referred to as the process in which developers create/design, develop,test and maintain software.It is important as it enhances critical,creative and problem solving skills with an aim to make life easier for humans.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning and requirement analysis- At this stage planning of the project is involved whereby the scope of the project is determined, objectives and goals are set and resources required are planned.

Defining requirements- All requirements are defined including both technical and functionak requirements.Reviews are made by the consumers and other developers and approvals for the project are made.

Designing architecture- In this stage , designing plans are made. Provision of both the low level and high level design for the project are made.

Developing product - The developers use specific programming code as per the DDS . Programmers follow the protocols set by the association.

Product testing _ The software is tested to ensure the smooth running of the application.

Deployment and maintenance of products -The product is tested in a real industrial environment and constructive feedback is given.If the product is good then it is released to other markets or a modified version of the product is made.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software developers write code to ensure the proper functioning of the code.They utilise the technical requirements adn provide estimations of costs.

Quality assurance engineer -Ensures that the software meets quality standards and criteria before it is launched to the market.

Project manager - Becomes incharge of the development of the product. He/she identifies the processes required inorder to have an efficiently functioning software.  

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

An IDE is a software that combines tools that a developer needs in order to create a software or applications. It is important to developers because the software provides tools such as debuggers, a compiler and editor and other tools in one place this in turn improves productivity and an integrated development which allows developers to create new applications faster and easily. An example is a mobile app development IDEs.

VC Systems

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Software developers face problems such as meeting deadlines, complexity of some softwares , constant changing of technology, mental fog and physical tiredness.

Strrategies that may be used in order to curb these challenges are: engaging in collaborative spaces whereby engineers help each other to create softwares and find solutions to the existing problems. Taking health breaks are important for their well being and reduces turedness and brain fog


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing involves testing the individual units of code to ensure that they work.

System testing is when the whole software is tested to ensure the proper functioning of the whole system and that it meets the requirements.

Integration testing involves testing of the different units to ensure that they all work together or simultaneously as intended.

Acceptance testing involves ensuring that the product meets the business market requirements and is functionally ready for users.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is a method of .It improves accuracy, efficiency and personalization thereby boosting the overall perforance and user experience.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

"Write an essay about cows."

Write a 500 word essay about Fressian cows."
